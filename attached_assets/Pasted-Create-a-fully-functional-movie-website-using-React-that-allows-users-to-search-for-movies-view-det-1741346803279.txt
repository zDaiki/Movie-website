Create a fully-functional movie website using React that allows users to search for movies, view details, get recommendations, and read/write reviews. The website will pull movie data from an external API like OMDb API or TMDb API to display information about movies.

Features:
Home Page:

Header: Navigation bar with links to "Home", "Trending Movies", "Search", and "Popular Genres."
Main Section: Display a featured movie carousel with the top-rated, popular, or trending movies.
Trending Movies: Display a list of trending movies in grid format with their title, poster, and rating.
Search Bar: A search bar where users can type to search for movies (integrated with an API).
Movie Search:

Allow users to search for movies by name or actor.
Display search results in a grid/list format with movie poster, title, year, and IMDB rating.
Pagination for search results (if necessary).
Movie Details Page:

When a user clicks on a movie, show a detailed page that includes:
Movie title, year, genre(s), director, actors, and plot summary.
Display movie poster and trailer (embed YouTube trailers if available).
IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes ratings, release date, and duration.
List of similar movies or recommendations.
User reviews and ratings (could be integrated via an external review system or custom backend).
Movie Recommendations:

Display a "Recommendations" section on the Movie Details page where users can see related movies based on the current movie's genre or actors.
User Reviews:

Allow users to write reviews for movies.
Users can rate movies and write text-based reviews.
Reviews should be visible to other users who visit the movie page.
Genre Pages:

Create individual pages for each genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror) and show a list of movies within each genre.
Genres should be accessible through the main menu or the footer.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the website is responsive and works across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
User Authentication (Optional):

Allow users to log in and sign up to submit reviews and save their favorite movies.
Use Firebase or another authentication service for handling user accounts.
Footer Section:

Include a footer with links to "Privacy Policy," "Contact," and "About Us."
Optionally, include social media links or the option to subscribe to a newsletter.
Error Handling and Loading States:

Display loading indicators when fetching data.
Show meaningful error messages if an API call fails or if no results are found.
Tech Stack:
Frontend:

React.js: The core library for building the UI.
React Router: For managing navigation across different pages (home, movie details, search results).
Axios or Fetch API: For making API requests to fetch movie data.
Styled-components or CSS Modules: For styling the components and ensuring responsiveness.
React Context API or Redux (Optional): For global state management, especially if you're managing user authentication or reviews.
React Query: For handling API data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
Backend (Optional):

If you want to implement user authentication and save reviews, you can use Firebase or Node.js with Express for the backend.
Firebase Authentication: For user authentication (if you implement it).
Firebase Firestore or a custom REST API: For storing user reviews and ratings.
External APIs:

OMDb API or TMDb API: To fetch movie data such as details, images, ratings, and reviews.
YouTube API (optional): To embed trailers for each movie.
Steps to Build:
Setup the Project:

Initialize a new React app using create-react-app or a custom Webpack setup.
Install necessary dependencies (React Router, Axios, etc.).
Set up your development environment and any third-party libraries you'll be using.
Create Components:

App: The main component that sets up routes and global state.
Header: A navigation bar component with links to different sections.
MovieCard: A card to display each movie (image, title, and rating).
MovieDetail: A component to display detailed information about a selected movie.
Search: A component with an input field to search for movies.
ReviewForm: A form to submit movie reviews.
Footer: A footer with basic site information and links.
Implement Movie Data Fetching:

Use Axios or Fetch API to get movie data from the OMDb or TMDb API.
Implement API calls in the relevant components (Home, Movie Search, Movie Details, etc.).
Handle loading and error states gracefully.
Implement Routing:

Set up React Router to navigate between the home page, movie details, search results, and genre pages.
Use dynamic routing to pass the movie ID to the Movie Details page.
Implement User Reviews:

Allow users to submit reviews (if implementing user authentication, store these reviews in a database like Firebase).
Display reviews below the movie details, sorted by date or rating.
Styling:

Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI for basic styling, or go custom with Styled-components.
Ensure the website is fully responsive, with mobile-first design.
